In this kingdom there were many villages and in each village there were many homes.
The people of this land were happy and lived in peace.
However, one day a mysterious stranger came to the kingdom.
This stranger brought news of a distant land where magic was real.
The king of the kingdom was intrigued and listened carefully to the stranger.
